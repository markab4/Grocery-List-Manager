There are four classes in my design

User: This class contains the functionality of the application for the user, such as creating, deleting, selecting, and renaming lists / list items

list: This is the list object class itself, defining the functions of the list as well as the attributes. Some of the list functions are checking the list, setting names, adding items, and sorting the list.

itemDB: This class looks up items in the database and also adds items to the DB by type.

ItemManagement: This class is used to manage the items that exist in the DB, by name and type.
