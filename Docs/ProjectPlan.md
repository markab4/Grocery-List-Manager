## 1 Introduction

 Tired of doing grocery lists with pencil and paper and unhappy with each and every existing app for managing grocery lists​? Our product is *GroceryListManager​*, an application for managing grocery lists that works exactly the way you want it.

## 2 Process Description

### Gather Requirements 
- The core requirements have been set by users, as listed in the [Requirements Document](Requirements.md)
- Exit criteria: Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary [use cases](UseCaseModel.md).

### Analyze & Design 
- Consists of determining whether the stated requirements are clear, complete, consistent and unambiguous, and resolving any apparent conflicts
- Entrance criteria: [Requirements](Requirements.md) as gathered from the users
- Exit criteria: 
    - [Use cases](UseCaseModel.md)  which describe scenarios for standard domain functions that the system must accomplish. 
    - [Class diagram](../Design-Team/design-team.png) describes the names, class relations, operations, and properties of the main classes. 
    - [User-interface mockups or prototypes](./DesignDocument.md) created to help understanding.

### Implement
- The part of the process where software engineers actually program the code for the *GroceryListManager*. Documentation is also done at this stage, as contained in the [User Manual](UserManual.md). We will be using Android Studio to build the Android App, and GitHub to manage version control and to track and assign issues.
- Entrance criteria: the requirements are established and the software design documents are complete 
- *Exit criteria: an initial version of the app released

### Test 
- Ensure that defects are recognized as soon as possible, covered in greater detail in the [Test Plan](TestPlan.md). GitHub will be used to track bugs and there will be a heavy reliance on manual testing to ensure the user interface is bug-free and any errors are caught. Both actual Android devices as well as emulators will be used in testing.
- Entrance criteria: An initial version of the app.
- Exit criteria: All bugs repaired and application fits the criteria specified in the Requirements Gathering and Design activities.

## 3 Team

*Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)*

- *Team members' names*
- *Roles, with a short description of each role*
- *Table showing which team member(s) has which role(s)*
