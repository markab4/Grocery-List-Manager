## Searching for an Item

You may find it to your advantage to utilize the searching feature to quickly find the item you are looking for. When adding an item to a list, click on the Search bar located at the top of the screen, and then enter the name of the item you are looking for. You may also enter partial queries and do not have to search on the full name of the item. If the item exists, you will find it displayed in a pop up. If the item does not exist, you will be notified that there are no results matching your entry. This will ease the process of creating new items if you do not know whether or not it exists in your application.

## Selecting Lists
Perhaps you need to make trips to multiple groceries, or you may find it to your advantage to have multiple lists for each store. With the Grocery List Manager you have the ability to create multiple lists which contain their own items. You can create a new list by going back to the launcher menu at any time, and selecting the option to create a new list once again. After you have set the name and finished creating the list, you can now select which list you wish to view when revisiting the launcher. To do this, from the launcher menu, click on the list you wish to view, this will open the list so you may view its contents.

## Checking Off Items
To maximize the utility of the Grocery List Manager, you might want to make use of the feature which allows you to check off items. This will allow you to track what you have purchased during your grocery trip, which will prevent you from repeatedly grabbing the same item when shopping. It'll also benefit you in making it clear once you have completed your grocery shopping needs. To check off items in your list, enter your list then press the box to the left of the item you wish to check off. This will now put a check in the box, indicating that you have put the item in your shopping cart.


You can clear all check boxes from a list by selecting the three dotted button at the top right of the screen, then selecting the "Clear All Boxes" option. This will clear all the check boxes, allowing you to convienently reuse the list as needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions
>I created a list and created new items, but I do not want to have to create these items every time when I shop. Will my items remain in the system?

When you create a new item, it is stored in the applications database, so you will not have to create that item again.

<br>

>Can I have two lists with the same items?

Yes, you can have two lists with the same items. 

<br>

>I created a list that I don't need anymore. If I delete my list, will I need to recreate the items that were added to that list?


No, when you create an item, it is added to the database. Deleting a list will remove that list and any items it contains, but the items will still exist in your database, so you will not have to recreate those items when adding them to a new list.
